              <h4>Full Stack Web Developer</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>As a full stack web developer, I love to code in javascript. In order to be a better developer, I'm learning things once at a time. My major technologies includes javascript and its framework, libraries. When I started to code, I was surprised by how front end development played out which helped me to push further in this field. I love making things with React based apps and as a backend I use Node.js. As a database, I love to use mongodb, mySQL and postgre. Currently, Iam learning Django, a python framework and its quite fun to build things from it. </p>
              <p>Life is an experience and experience it with loads of knowledge.<p>
